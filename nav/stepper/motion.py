        Change Log
                [0.1.0] Jonathan
                        --- GPIO arg has been added to allow functionality of
                        the robots wheels. This allows us to manipulate IO pins.
                        Wheels have corrected names based off of their position.
        Change Log
                [0.2.0] Jonathan
                        --- Direction is now a boolean True or False. Since other
                        directions will be included later on, this is temporary.
                        ValueError Exception is now thrown when direction is not 
                        set to be True or False. Delay argument has been added 
                        that defaults to STEPPER_DELAY. This allows us to change 
                        the speed via the parameter.

                [0.2.5] Jonathan
                        --- New constants for STEPS_PER_REVOLUTION and 
                        STEPS_PER_INCH have been made individually for different 
                        robots in constants.py. Constant STEPS_PER_INCH has been 
                        updated to QUARTER_STEPS_PER_INCH in motion.py and 
                        QUARTER_STEPS_PER_REVOLUTION in reference.py.
